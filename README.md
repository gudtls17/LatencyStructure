Resting-state fMRI captures intrinsic brain activity, yet the physical significance of latency structures remains unclear. In this study, the spatiotemporal properties of fMRI-derived latency structures are examined by linking them to biophysical model-based neural functions, intrinsic neural timescales, and functional gradients. Their clinical relevance in autism spectrum disorder is also explored.
